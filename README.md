# Customer Engagement Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes customer survey data from a mid-sized clothing retail chain with 30 stores nationwide. The analysis focuses on understanding customer profiles and spending patterns to inform marketing strategy development. It provides key insights into customer demographics, spending behavior, store performance, and loyalty programs.

### Project Goals
The objective of this analysis is to:
1. Identify key spending trends by age group, customer type, and location.
2. Provide insights into the effectiveness of loyalty programs.
3. Highlight underperforming stores and suggest targeted marketing strategies.
4. Explore opportunities to increase engagement and spending among low-frequency shoppers.

### Key Insights
- Spending Patterns by Age Group: Younger customers (ages 15-35) tend to spend above average. There is potential to broaden the customer base by focusing promotions on age groups outside the 15-45 range.
- Dominant Female Customer Base: 74% of customers are female, and maintaining this engagement while attracting more male customers is a key strategy.
- Loyalty Program Impact: Customers with loyalty cards tend to spend more. A strategy to convert non-loyalty customers into members could drive revenue.
- Store Performance: Oxford Street has the highest average spend (Â£66.42), while locations like Sheffield High Street need focused efforts to improve customer spending.
- Targeting Low-Frequency Shoppers: Customers who visit once a month or less have significantly lower average spending. Targeted strategies to increase their store visits and engagement are crucial.
